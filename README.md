Week 4 assignment
## Background
The project is to assist a school district in analyzing student test scores to help them make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. The task is to aggregate the data to display trends in school performance.

## Findings
* District Summary: 
85% of the students in the district are passing reading whereas only 75% are passing math. Only 65% are passing both math and reading.

* School Summary: The overall passing rate between high schools varies from a low of 53% to a high of 91%, which is a large difference between schools. The top five schools for overall passing rates are all charter schools and the bottom five are all district schools.

* Scores by School Spending: The school spending review shows that the amount of money spent per student is not increasing the passing rates, in fact, the schools with budgets on the lower end have the higher overall passing rates.

* Scores by School Size: The small and medium size schools have an overall passing rate of close to 90%. The large schools overall passing rate drops dramatically to 58%. Most of the large schools are district schools.

* Scores by School Type: The charter schools have an overall passing rate of 90%, whereas the district schools have an overall passing rate of only 53%. It'd be interesting to investigate the specific differences between the charter schools and the district schools to identify what the specific factors impacting passing rates may be. Things to look into here would be size (perhaps compared to other districts), number of students per classroom, neighborhood, and more.
